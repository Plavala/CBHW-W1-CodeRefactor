# CBHW-W1-CodeRefactor
Week one home work. subject Code refactor.Fixing and ajusted given code.

## Description
For our first week home work we where given a web page, that was partially fully functioning, to modify and adjust withen the HTML and 
CSS.

*Here is an example of what that page looks like and should stay looking like.*

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

We were tasked to fix a variety of items on the page regarding the links such as adding ID tags for the CSS to recognize and corrected positioning so all links would be fully functioning. We were also tasked to go through the CSS to adjust and do some clean up so the code would be both easier to read and look more organized. Tags were added to be able to locate functions within the HTML and CSS much more efficiently. Finally, once all criteria have been met, we are asked to submit repository threw Github. 

List of acceptance criteria:
- Meets all accessibility standards
- Applies semantic HTML elements
- Includes accessible alt attributes in images
- Heading attributes are in order
- The elements are in a logical structure that is independent of styling and positioning
- Includes descriptive title element
- Make sure all link are functioning correctly
